# smartThermostat
This is a small project to create a smart thermostat to control the underfloor heating at my apartment in Berlin.

## Requirements

### Heating

My Heating system has a thermostat in every room. It works basically with a bimetal strip that activates a relais with a 230V signal.

### Hardware
I use an arduino nano, a 5V relais, a DHT22 temperature (and humidity) sensor and a small 32x128 oled display.
